       "1  in more recent years the concept of white privilege has gained considerable standing in national discussions over race developed as term for societal privileges that benefit people identified as white social privileges that are not commonly experienced by non white people under the same conditions there are two primary problems with this as see it first the idea of white privilege reifies race unlike the color blindness approach to racial inequality the white privilege or critical race theory approach makes white identity dominant force of history but whiteness in this view is not divorced from historical agents white people therefore become the architects of history and the only group with agency while claiming to deconstruct whiteness proponents of white privilege theory end up essentializing it and providing whites with self identification as whites which leads to the second problem the group interests attached to whiteness white privilege is described as set of privileges and even rights for example the privilege of not being targeted by police because of your race indeed many of the examples used by proponents of the theory involve law enforcement other examples include advantages in housing education and employment markets even when there is no race conscious decision being made as result sometimes of social networks unconscious bias and of course historical advantages the net result of reifying white privilege and identifying it with concrete material interests however is to create situation where proponents of white privilege in essence tell whites that they are distinct and advantaged social group that has material interests rational political actor would ordinarily advance their material interests but proponents of white privilege appear to believe that moral case against white privilege can persuade or perhaps shame whites into acting against these material interests is that at all likely or is it more likely that proponents of this theory will unwittingly unleash new forms of racial consciousness among whites that will advance white interests at the expense of racial minorities think that the latter is more likely if you disagree change my view   \n",
