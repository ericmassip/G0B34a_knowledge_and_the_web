       "1  don think donald trump was bragging about getting away with sexual assault in the access hollywood tapes first of all yes of course it is sexual assault to grab woman genitalia without their consent but it is not sexual assault if it consensual and that what donald trump is bragging about in the tape for reference here the transcript of the relevant portion trump yeah that her with the gold better use some tic tacs just in case start kissing her you know automatically attracted to beautiful just start kissing them it like magnet just kiss don even wait and when you re star they let you do it you can do anything bush whatever you want trump grab them by the you can do anything ve bolded the phrase they let you do it because that reference to consent with they referring to the woman on the receiving end of his actions trump is not bragging about his wealth and fame allowing him to get away with groping women without their consent which again absolutely would be sexual assault he is instead bragging that his wealth and his fame make him so sexually attractive to women that they consent to being groped by him and that why he and his defenders are so insistent on it being locker room talk because while bragging about sexual assault is not normal in locker rooms outlandish claims about one sexual attractiveness and prowess absolutely are and just to be clear not defending trump here think that trump did not brag about sexual assault in the tapes but not saying that if he did what he said he did those women actually did consent in fact given the stories from the women who have come forward so far think it likely that they did not and think the takeaway of my view trump believes he was bragging about consensual sexual activity is that trump doesn truly understand what consent is and that might actually be even worse but it worse in way that underlines just how deeply rooted misogyny is and that can be dismissed as trump sociopath and an aberration   \n",

       "3  yeah uh thats not understanding pro choice the point is that the women can how to regard the fetus do you think that the women who exercises her choice by carrying the child to term regards it as parasite of course not it the child she psyched to have however what the pro choice individual believes is that women_ gets to decide how to regard the fetus because it is her body_ and she doen have to set aside her right to determine how to regard things that take up residence inside her for any reason of course there are other reasons people are pro choice but this hardly shift from the mainstream perspective on choice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
