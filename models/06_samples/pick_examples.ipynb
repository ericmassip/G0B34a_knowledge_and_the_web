       "1  voted republican in the past elections so since you re simply asking for explanations of these views ll offer few can say don care at all what people do in the privacy of their own homes but also don believe the government should be in the business of defining what marriage is one way or the other the concept of marriage is deeply tied to cultural and religious values which obviously vary drastically and will constantly be butting up against whatever legal definition we give it today but realize the tax benefits are an issue and don really know how to solve it most importantly though this is not deal breaker for me nor is it for almost any other republican personally know you re right it stupid most republicans know agree on immigration first we have to be with any claims about how many illegal immigrants are actually here seeing as there are pretty big discrepancies among the data but assuming pew is correct it doesn really get to the heart of the issue as trump supporter what see from majority of the people on the left is an unwillingness to admit that we should strive to eliminate illegal immigration and that this has to start with enforcement of the current law of the land see people demonized for simply acknowledging million illegals receiving many benefits that us citizens is definitely not ideal it will suck for some people to be denied entry but the intention is to bring them over legally not keep them out forever don really care about the wall care that our current laws are enforced the majority people recently who have stated this clearly and unambiguously are republicans but your argument here seems to be illegal immigration is decreasing faster than most republicans acknowledge and to that would say yes you are right will not get into the statistical claims because the debate see is about whether or not we should treat immigration to the usa as right or privilege people holding up nowall signs are most often against the idea of simply keeping people out not that the wall costs too much in my experience   \n",

       "3  this one pretty self explanatory satanism is religion and if you respect all religions that inherently must include satanism and this means that in any circumstance where it would be appropriate to for example say god bless or promote christian imagery besides churches or other places of worship of course where it is reasonable to only be promoting that particular religion it must be equally acceptable to say hail satan as well either that or all religions should be equally silenced but that would be just as unfair as well as oppressive to all religious people edit since people don get it apparently respect all religions is commonly used phrase regarding non discrimination against religions also pastafarianism is irrelevant wether or not it is religion changes nothing about satanism so you can cut that out too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
